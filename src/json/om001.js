      info: 'SUNTAR 909 is a typeface inspired by found material discovered at an estate sale in El Cerrito, CA on September 23, 2018. A line of Super 8mm film viewers and editors, Suntar products were made in Japan by Sansei Koki circa 1970s. The graphic design accompanying these products as logo and packaging is absolutely incredible; it’s so good I designed a typeface based on the original logotype. This typeface might already exist, but I wanted to define a new typeface that considered the “spinning” circle icon and the relationship between the sans-serif numbers “909”.',

      info: 'Alexander Calder (American, 1898–1976) revolutionized sculpture by inviting unseen forces of the natural world to participate in his art. The works in this exhibition manifest the ways the elements—including the movement of the sea and the blowing of the wind—provided both subject matter and inspiration for many of Calder’s mobiles. As Jean-Paul Sartre once noted of his works, “One of Calder’s objects is like the sea and equally spellbinding: always beginning over again, always new.”',
